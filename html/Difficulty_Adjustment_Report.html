It\u0027s derived from PriceUSD\u0027.rolling(window=200).mean().\n  - Buy Target: 0.7 times the 200-day moving average price.\n  - Sell Target: 2.2 times the 200-day moving average price.\n\n  **NVT Price:**\n  - Description: The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Price is a metric that measures Bitcoin\u0027s market capitalization against the volume of transactions happening on its network. It is calculated using a formula that takes the median of the NVT ratio over a two-year period, multiplies it with the transaction volume in USD, and divides it by the current supply of bitcoins.\n  - Interpretation \u0026 Usage: The NVT Price helps in evaluating the relative valuation of Bitcoin. A high NVT Price can signal that Bitcoin is overvalued compared to the value of transactions occurring on the network, while a low NVT Price might indicate undervaluation. It is a useful tool for investors to gauge the market dynamics and make informed decisions based on Bitcoin\u0027s on-chain economic activity.\n  - Model Price: The NVT Price is derived from the formula: (NVTAdj.rolling(window=365*2).median() * TxTfrValAdjUSD\u0027 / \u0027SplyCur\u0027 which calculates the market cap to transaction volume ratio based on a 2-year median rolling window.\n  - Buy Target: 0.5 times the NVT model price.\n  - Sell Target: 2.0 times the NVT model price.\n\n  **Realized Price:**\n  - Description: This metric denotes the average price at which all available bitcoins were last transacted.\n  - Interpretation \u0026 Usage: It provides a comprehensive view into the average cost basis of Bitcoin holders, offering insights into prevailing market sentiment and potential price support zones.\n  - Model Price: Calculated as the total realized market capitalization divided by the current supply of bitcoins. It is represented by the formula: Realized Price = CapRealUSD / SplyCur Here, \"CapRealUSD\" represents the realized market capitalization and \"SplyCur\" represents the current supply of bitcoins.\n  - Buy Target: 0.8 times the Realized Price.\n  - Sell Target: 3.0 times the Realized Price.\n\n  **ThermoCap Price:**\n- Description: The ThermoCap Price is a metric that contrasts Bitcoin\u0027s market capitalization with the total revenue generated from mining activities, including block rewards and transaction fees. It offers insights into the financial health and intrinsic value of the Bitcoin network from a miner revenue perspective.\n- Interpretation \u0026 Usage: This metric assists investors in understanding the market\u0027s valuation of Bitcoin based on the revenue generated from mining activities.\n- Model Price: The ThermoCap Model Price is  the 8x ThermoCap Multiple. Which is calcualted by 8 * \u0027thermocap_multiple\u0027 = CapMrktCurUSD / RevAllTimeUSD\u0027 \n- Buy Target: 5 times the ThermoCap\n- Sell Target: 25 times the ThermoCap.\n\n  **Stock-to-Flow (S/F) Model Price:**\n- Description: The Stock-to-Flow (S/F) model price is derived from a valuation model that relates the price of Bitcoin to its scarcity, which is measured by the S/F ratio. The S/F ratio is calculated as the total supply of Bitcoin divided by the annual production (flow) of new bitcoins.\n- Interpretation \u0026 Usage: The S/F model price serves as a tool to estimate the intrinsic value of Bitcoin based on its scarcity. A high S/F ratio indicates increased scarcity and potentially higher value. Investors can use the S/F multiple, which is the actual price divided by the S/F model price, to identify overvalued or undervalued conditions in the market. \n- Model Price: The S/F Model Price formula is SF_Predicted_Price=exp(intercept)*exp(intercept)*(SF ratio)^slope\n- Buy Target: 0.3 times the SF model price. \n- Sell Target: 3.0 times the SF model price.\n\n  **Silver Market Cap:**\n- **Description:** This metric calculates the price at which Bitcoin\u0027s market cap would match the entire market cap of all mined silver.\n- **Interpretation \u0026 Usage:** It provides a perspective on Bitcoin\u0027s valuation, highlighting its potential to stand alongside traditional precious metals in terms of market capitalization.\n- **Model Calculatoin: ** The model calculation evaluates the potential of Bitcoin achieving the market cap of Silver in 10 years. It assigns different probability scenarios (bull, base, bear) to represent the likelihood of each occurrence. Utilizing the 10 year Treasruy yield as a discount rate, these projected values are then discounted back to their present value.\n- **Model Price:** The bull case value.\n- **Buy Target:** The base case value.\n- **Sell Target:** The current total market cap of silver, representing a scenario where Bitcoin fully realizes its potential compared to silver.\n- **Probabilities:** The probabilities assigned to the bull, base, and bear cases are 95%, 80%, and 50% respectively, indicating different levels of confidence in these scenarios.\n\n  **UK M0 Price:**\n- **Description:** This metric projects the price at which Bitcoin\u0027s market cap would equal the total monetary base (M0) of the United Kingdom.\n- **Interpretation \u0026 Usage:** By comparing Bitcoin\u0027s market cap with the UK\u0027s M0, investors can gauge Bitcoin\u0027s growth potential and its capacity to parallel traditional fiat systems in terms of market valuation.\n- **Model Calculatoin: ** The model calculation evaluates the potential of Bitcoin achieving the market cap of UK M0 in 10 years. It assigns different probability scenarios (bull, base, bear) to represent the likelihood of each occurrence. Utilizing the 10 year Treasruy yield as a discount rate, these projected values are then discounted back to their present value.\n- **Model Price:** The bull case value.\n- **Buy Target:** The base case value.\n- **Sell Target:** The current total monetary base (M0) of the United Kingdom, representing a scenario where Bitcoin fully realizes its potential compared to the UK\u0027s fiat system.\n  - **Probabilities:** The probabilities assigned to the bull, base, and bear cases are 65%, 35%, and 10% respectively, indicating different levels of confidence in these scenarios.\n\n  **Apple Market Cap:**\n- **Description:** This metric projects the price at which Bitcoin\u0027s market cap would equal the market cap of Apple, the world\u0027s most valuable company by market capitalization.\n- **Interpretation \u0026 Usage:** It offers investors a perspective on Bitcoin\u0027s potential growth, highlighting its capacity to rival the market capitalization of leading global corporations.\n- **Model Calculatoin: ** The model calculation evaluates the potential of Bitcoin achieving the market cap of Apple in 10 years. It assigns different probability scenarios (bull, base, bear) to represent the likelihood of each occurrence.
